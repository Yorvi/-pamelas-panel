    Welcome to A. Philip Randolph Campus High School (APRCHS).<Br> 
    <br>
    <img src="https://img.etsystatic.com/il/cc9782/1205811763/il_570xN.1205811763_64yd.jpg?version=1" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px;" width="250" height="300">
    APRCHS was founded in 1979 as an educational collaboration between the New York City Department of Education the City College of New York. Since that time APRCHS has produced generations of successful students who have gone on to great success in college and  their adult careers. A. Philip Randolph said that “A community is democratic only when the humblest and  weakest person can enjoy the highest civil, economic, and social rights that the biggest and most powerful  possess.” The mission of A. Philip Randolph Campus High School is to provide the highest quality education to  public high school students in order to provide them with the skills and experiences necessary to prepare them  to succeed in our nation’s top competitive colleges and universities.<br>
    <br>
    APRCHS provides its students with the opportunity to pursue academic excellence by participating in advanced   courses of study in our medical, engineering, and humanities academies. Students in the academies are   expected to complete rigorous coursework in their respective fields that will better prepare them for their   collegiate experiences in these areas. Students who distinguish themselves in their coursework have the opportunity to enroll in free college courses through CCNY, BMCC and Touro Colleges, participate in special programs such as the GATEWAY pre-med honors society, and are given the opportunity to apply for internships. <br>
    <br>
    APRCHS offers a wide range of extra-curricular and athletic activities to broaden and engage our students outside of the classroom. Our after school activities range from activities such as musical and arts productions to exciting STEM activities such as the FIRST robotics competition. APRCHS offers a full range of PSAL endorsed sports such as varsity baseball, basketball, track, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, volleyball, and wrestling. <br>
    <br>

While we are proud of this site, the only true way to fully experience, comprehend, and appreciate the unparalleled opportunities available at Randolph is to visit the school.
